                    SNP stands for “single nucleotid polymorphism”. You can see it as a difference in your DNA that makes you different from other people. Some SNPs may be associated to a known trait such as the color of your eyes. It can be of particular interest to look at which of your trait’s expression is not commonly found in the general population, which is what we are looking at
